        <h2>wait why? and what now?</h2>
        <h3>as a short explanation, while i enjoyed developing a bluesky/deer.social fork, adding my own little features to it and trying to maintain it as much as possible, i really could not handle having an actual userbase.<br><br>it was honestly really stressful, it felt like i needed to do everything as perfectly as possible or else i was just gonna piss off a lot of people at the same time and i did not want to experience that, not again, didnt really help that i was getting feature requests for things i did not have the skill to even pull off in the first place, it felt like there were a lot of expectations people had of me that, while reasonable on their end, was just completely unrealistic for me to be able to meet.<br><br>this was never meant to be a fork used by a wide group of people, it was more just meant for me and a few friends, when i saw the fork get brought up randomly in posts by people who didnt even follow me and get advertised on websites and other things, while it seemed a little cool people even had interest in the first place, it worried me a lot and like always i didnt take it very well.<br><br>in short: person cant handle a lot of eyes on something they were hosting, shuts it down from insane stress.<br><br>so if this fork isnt available anymore, what else could i use?</h3>

        <h3>u can just always use the original <a href="https://deer.social">deer.social</a>, while it doesnt get worked on anymore, its still a pretty neat fork and my fork was completely based on it, so mentioning it here only makes sense, my fork wouldnt have even existed if <a href="https://deer.social">deer.social</a> didnt exist.</h3>

        <h3><a href="https://witchsky.app">witchsky.app</a> however is more likely what u wanna use instead, even when my fork was still being worked on, <a href="https://witchsky.app">witchsky.app</a> was always a fork of my fork with just way more features added to it, it basically obsoleted my work before i even killed it off, so pretty much, if u liked the new features i added here, all of them are available in <a href="https://witchsky.app">witchsky.app</a> plus a bunch more changes, i even semi frequently contribute to <a href="https://tangled.org/jollywhoppers.com/witchsky.app">witchsky</a>! so its kinda like my fork never even left :P<br><br>thats basically all, thanks for reading and thanks for using kitty/social.daniela.lol!<br><br>if u ever wanna reach me, my bluesky is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daniela.lol">@daniela.lol</a></h3>
